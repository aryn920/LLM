News Research Tool üóûÔ∏èüìà
The News Research Tool is an advanced AI-driven application designed to simplify the analysis and retrieval of information from news articles. Leveraging a combination of powerful libraries and frameworks, this tool provides a seamless and efficient way to process, analyze, and extract insights from news content.

Key Libraries and Technologies
Streamlit: The front-end framework used to build an interactive and user-friendly interface. Streamlit allows users to input URLs, view processing progress, and interact with the tool effortlessly.

Langchain: Utilized for chaining together various language models and tasks. This library helps in managing the workflow of data processing and querying, ensuring smooth integration of different components.

FAISS: Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) is used for efficient vector-based document retrieval. FAISS indexes the embeddings generated from the news articles, enabling fast and accurate search capabilities.

OpenAI Embeddings: Employed to convert text data into high-dimensional vector representations. These embeddings allow the tool to understand and process the semantic content of the articles, facilitating advanced search and retrieval features.

Features
Multi-URL Processing: Users can input up to four news article URLs. The tool fetches and processes content from these URLs, preparing it for analysis.

Text Splitting & Chunking: Articles are divided into manageable chunks using text splitting techniques to enhance embedding generation and information retrieval.

Semantic Search: With FAISS and OpenAI embeddings, the tool provides semantic search capabilities, allowing users to find relevant information quickly and accurately.

Question Answering: Users can pose questions about the processed articles, and the tool generates context-aware answers using the language models, with sources provided for reference.

Use Case
Ideal for researchers, journalists, and information analysts, this tool automates the extraction of valuable insights from multiple news sources, offering a streamlined approach to information retrieval and analysis.
